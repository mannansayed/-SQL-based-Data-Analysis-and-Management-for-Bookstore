# -SQL-based-Data-Analysis-and-Management-for-Bookstore

ðŸš€ Excited to share that I recently completed the SQL Assignment provided by Satish Dhawale, founder of Skill Course!
In this assignment, I worked on Hospital Data and wrote SQL queries to extract key insights such as:
 âœ… Total number of patients across hospitals
 âœ… Average number of doctors per hospital
 âœ… Top 3 departments with the highest patient count
 âœ… Hospital with the maximum medical expenses
 âœ… Monthly expense reports, patient stay analysis & more
This hands-on project really helped me strengthen my SQL skills in data querying, grouping, and analysis.
